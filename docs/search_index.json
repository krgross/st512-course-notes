Suppose that observation is \\(X=2\\). We can use the dpois function to evaluate the likelihood for this single observation. For example, we can evaluate the likelihood at \\(\\lambda = 1.5\\): dpois(x = 2, lambda = 1.5) ## [1] 0.2510214 Or we could evaluate the likelihood at \\(\\lambda = 2\\) or \\(\\lambda = 2.5\\): dpois(x = 2, lambda = c(2, 2.5)) ## [1] 0.2706706 0.2565156 Now lets evaluate the likelihood at a sequence of \\(\\lambda\\) values: lambda.vals &lt;- seq(from = 0, to = 5, by = 0.01) my.lhood &lt;- dpois(x = 2, lambda = lambda.vals) plot(lambda.vals, my.lhood, xlab = expression(lambda), ylab = &quot;Likelihood&quot;, type = &quot;l&quot;) "]]
